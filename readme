
This project matches a file of strings to strings in another file, for now.


How to get this stuff to work.

Download simstring, or just grab the source in lib/ Follow the instructions in the simstring package for compiling it for c++. I had to add
#include <unistd.h>
to memory_mapped_file_posix.h to get it to work. 

In src/getClipNames is a Python hack that extract clip titles from
json files. This is uses for bulk testing mostly. Noone in their right
mind should use that stuff.

src/linkHeadlines.cpp does the job. Just compile it with whatever compiler you prefer.
This should work: "g++ linkheadlines.cpp -o linkheadlines"

linkHeadlines.cpp is a bit of a mess but it does the job for now. It takes one argument that should be a float between 0 and 1. This argument is passed to the matching algorithm which is currently hardcoded to cosine. It is rather easy to switch it around.

You can use something like this plus visual inspection to test it:
./linkheadline 0.5 > cosine05 ; wc -l cosine05

if you are using file input, make sure it is the same encoding or results will be suboptimal.


Possibly, maybe recommended values per algorithm:
cosine: 0.5     <-- Recommended
overlap: 0.4    <-- Also good for this purpuse
dice: 0.4
jaccard: 0.9    <-- Giving a lot of double results/false positives. Need more investingations.
exact: Dont use this!
